# Getting started
Document here - Summary of Delft Scuba Mask.

A short article, to be replaced by the real summary as it emerges.

We'll put in one illustration just to prove how this should be set up:  images in the Readme should path to the /docs/img folder where they normally reside. This keeps the top of the design repo clean:  just the Readme(.md), and the 640pxx640px or so-sized summary.jpg, which is for the app Finder to present on searches.

![CPAP Front View](docs/img/cpap_600b.jpg)*CPAP Front View*

As you can see in the markdown document for this, it's easy to use the apparently official way to do Figure Captions, for reference.

This is different from the words in the square brackets, as those are the Alt Text for fully  accessible browser view.

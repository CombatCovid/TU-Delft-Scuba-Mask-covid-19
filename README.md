# Getting started

Document here - Summary of Delft Scuba Mask.

A short article, to be replaced by the real summary as it emerges.

We'll put in one illustration just to prove how this should be set up: images in the README should path to the /docs/img folder where they normally reside.

This keeps the top of the design repo clean: just the README(.md), and the 640pxx640px or so-sized summary.jpg, which is for the app Finder to present on searches.

Here's the example, an attractive introduction to this design:

![CPAP Front View](docs/img/cpap_600b.jpg)_CPAP Front View_

As you can see in the markdown document for this, it's easy to use the apparently official way to do Figure Captions, for reference.

This is different from the words in the square brackets, as those are the Alt Text for fully accessible browser view.

It's also important to address the image in the _docs/img_ folder, not the _/img_ folder if one exists, and that the path always start without a slash (/): as simply _docs/img/cpap_600b.jpg_ in this case.

Happily, we've been able to remove this last and uncomfortable requirement by an upgrade in CombatCovid app. So you may already notice many more images of your repo's images showing -- all of them now, without the extra work.

~~The last point is that letter case is very important, particularly on the dot-ending part of file names, or they won't be found. So, always, _.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif_ -- Not, _.JPG_, etc..~~

Your viewers will thank you for these things, and so will we!

# Getting started
Document here - Summary of Delft Scuba Mask.

We'll put in one illustration just to prove how this should be set up:  images in the Readme should path to the /docs/img folder where they normally reside. This keeps the top of the design repo clean:  just Readme.md, and summary.jpg, which is for the app Finder to present on searches.

This is apparently the official way to do Figure Captions, for reference.

A short article, to be replaced by the real summary as it emerges..gitignore
